# Data Exploration of Bay Wheels System Dataset
## by Naomi Nemeth

> This is the final project from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Dataset

> This dataset consists in a set of information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system around the area of San Francisco city. 
The goal for Bay Wheels is offering a fun and economical way of going through the city for two blocks or 2 miles. About this system, Bay Wheels (previously Ford GoBike), is a bike-sharing system with different types of subscriptions: you can ride just one time, for a day or have unlimited rides, of course with different pricing for each subscription. They have lots of bicycle types, even electric ones, to attend every consumer needs. 


## Summary of Findings

> In this project, we aimed to analyze the dataset from Bay Wheels to **understand or at least find some insights about the consumer behaviour in the bay area**. The Bay Wheels shares all the data from each ride in their website (you can find it here: https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data ), for this project we are going to focus on the data from 2017's last semester. It's large amount of data almost 520k rows with 15 columns (variables). 

> In order to achieve our goal, this analysis will be guided by the following points:
    - When are most trips taken in terms of day of week?
    - How long does the average trips takes? Does it changes over the weekday?
    - Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or a customer? Do they have a different habit behaviour?

> **Findings**
    - By performing this analysis, we managed to answer all three guiding points. So, the weekdays had more rides than on weekends, but on the weekend, rides were much longer. 
    - The average trips took from 7 to 15 minutes and it increased by the weekend to over 26 minutes.
    - It's possible to affirm that customer and subscribers have very different behaviour. Subscribers use the Bay Wheels more frequently and on a weekday, it's part of his mobility journey and rides are faster. As for customers, they use Bay Wheels's bikes on the weekend, stays more time with it and use it to enjoy their free time.

    

## Key Insights for Presentation

> My presentation will focus on the three guiding points above, from the very begining with assessing and cleaning data until multivariate exploration visualizations. 

> I had polished all the graphs while doing Data Exploration analysis, so for this presentation I just selected which visualizations explained better the insights.

> I had some feedback on my presentation and exploratory analysis, some points were highlighted, so I made some changes in how I was explaining my analysis and visualizations.I had a lot of fun analysing this dataset! Certainly, there is a huge space to keep extracting insights from it, using maps and some more numeric features.
